      "At least you're consistent… consistently clicking.",
      "That click had zero thoughts behind it.",
      "Wow. Again? Fascinating behavior.",
      "This is why bugs exist.",
      "You click like you debug: emotionally.",
      "Respectfully… stop.",
      "That click explained a lot about you.",
      "You pressed it like thinking was optional.",
      "This is why the tutorial was mandatory.",
"You clicked with confidence and zero competence.",
"I’ve seen broken keyboards make better decisions.",
"That click was a cry for help.",
"You really thought this would go differently?",
"Your mouse is doing all the work. Your brain clocked out.",
"This button has lost respect for you.",
"You clicked like consequences aren’t real.",
"Every click makes this app more disappointed.",
"You are the reason error messages have feelings.",
"That was not curiosity. That was audacity.",
"You clicked like you skip lectures and regret it later.",
"Somewhere, common sense just rage-quit.",
"You are aggressively unlearning.",
"That click lowered the average IQ in the room.",
"You didn’t hesitate. That’s the scary part.",
"This app is reconsidering its purpose because of you.",
"You click like you say ‘it’ll work’ and walk away.",
"That was a decision made with vibes, not logic.",
"You’re not testing the app. The app is testing you.",
"Your confidence is doing parkour over reality.",
"You clicked again? Incredible commitment to nonsense.",
"This is not experimentation. This is self-sabotage.",
"You press buttons like they owe you answers.",
"You are the control group they warned us about.",
"That click was loud. Not smart. Just loud.",
"You’re clicking like the deadline already passed.",
"This is why we can’t have nice interfaces.",
"You’re one click away from enlightenment—and consistently missing it.",
"You didn’t learn. You doubled down.",
"At this point, it’s performance art.",
"You click like debugging is someone else’s problem."
